# Aarambh - Agentic Ai with Human Creativity.

## Inspiration & Ideation
This project is inspired by lot of the AgenticAi's recently flowing into the tech space. Aarambh is an idea where we combine LLM's via agentic workflow's and create / schedule (good) content for everyone.

This is a project being worked upon by [unravler media](https://unrmedia.framer.media/) and this is a rather risky bet, with the recent news on growing Ai generated content nowadays people are trying to create these content productions systems that generate content on autopilot. We aim to do that, starting off with Web-Readable content where Ai will:
1. Research
2. Learn
3. Write
4. Optimise

This platform also allows individuals like you to also write good piece of content here, and ofcourse our systems will try to learn from them. *hope to include such functionality in future ðŸ˜Œ

## Technical Specifications
This project has two sections:
1. Backend - written in pure golang
2. Frontend - written in React with ShadCN

Backend is in GoLang and it is written in Pure Go and by a Human: [Tushar Singh](https://github.com/lonexd3vil/)

Frontend however is written by Ai with what we call nowadays as VibeCoding*, we are using Lovable to accompolish our Frontend Requirements and this helps us reduce development time a lot allowing us to focus more on the backend logic and produce results faster.
